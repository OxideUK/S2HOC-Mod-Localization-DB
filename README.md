# Stalker 2 Mod Localization Database

Localization is a frustrating part of any mod due to the fact that only a single Localization can be active at a time. Attempts to maintain a centralized localization file are difficult, and require one unfortunate individual collect and compile a growing list of localizations on an almost daily basis. S2MLDB is (yet another) attempt to get a handle on localization, but what sets it apart?

- Realtime Updates - Modders can update their localization files whenever they want, so no more waiting for an individual to find the time to add new files after each update.
- Collaborative Translation - Whilst AI tools can make translation easier, they're far from perfect. Users can suggest revisions to translations for the mod creator to review and include.
- Pre-packed Localization - Assembled localization files will be made available on a regular basis; with multiple modders having access, users won't have to wait long for updated files.
- Raw JSON Access - Users can download any combination of localization files they want and easily compile them.
